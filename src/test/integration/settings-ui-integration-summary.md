## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all integration tests
node src/test/run-settings-ui-integration-tests.js
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Extension tests only
npm test -- --grep "Settings UI Integration Tests"

# Angular tests only
cd webview && npm test -- --config=karma.integration.conf.js
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Set CI environment
export CI=true
node src/test/run-settings-ui-integration-tests.js
```
