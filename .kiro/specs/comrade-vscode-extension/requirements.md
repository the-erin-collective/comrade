# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Comrade is a VS Code extension that provides a flexible coding agent system with configurable LLM backends for different areas of concern. The MVP focuses on "speed mode" - a reactive iterative loop with two main phases: planning and execution. Users can configure different LLM agents for each phase or use the same model for both. The system includes a personality configuration to maintain consistent tone across different models and interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and configure the Comrade extension with my preferred LLM providers, so that I can use different models for planning and execution phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for planning and execution agents
2. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI-compatible API endpoints, local Ollama instances, and other standard LLM providers
3. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults or prompt for required settings
4. IF an API key is required THEN the system SHALL securely store credentials using VS Code's secret storage with consideration for OAuth authentication where available
5. WHEN testing agent connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and provide clear error messages for failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the personality and tone of agent responses, so that I can maintain consistency across different models and match my preferred communication style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension initializes THEN the system SHALL create a default `.comrade/personality.md` file if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN sending prompts to any agent THEN the system SHALL include the personality description as context
3. WHEN the personality file is modified THEN the system SHALL use the updated personality in subsequent interactions
4. IF the personality file is missing THEN the system SHALL use a built-in default personality
5. WHEN switching between different LLM models THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent tone based on the personality configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate contextual understanding of my workspace, so that the planning agent has comprehensive information about my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger context creation THEN the system SHALL analyze the current workspace files and structure
2. WHEN analyzing the workspace THEN the system SHALL respect .gitignore and common ignore patterns
3. WHEN context is generated THEN the system SHALL create a structured summary including file types, dependencies, and key components
4. IF the workspace is too large THEN the system SHALL intelligently sample or summarize to stay within token limits
5. WHEN context creation completes THEN the system SHALL save the context data for use by planning agents

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create implementation plans through an iterative planning process, so that I can get well-structured action lists for my development tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate planning THEN the system SHALL use the workspace context and my requirements to generate an initial plan
2. WHEN planning iterates THEN the system SHALL refine the plan based on previous iterations and feedback
3. WHEN the plan is generated THEN the system SHALL create a structured action list with clear, executable steps
4. IF planning encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions
5. WHEN planning completes THEN the system SHALL save the action list in a format suitable for execution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute the generated action plans with appropriate error handling, so that code changes are implemented reliably with recovery capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger execution THEN the system SHALL process the action list sequentially
2. WHEN executing actions THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress feedback
3. IF an execution step fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery using the configured execution agent
4. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL modify the remaining action list based on the current state
5. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of completed actions and any remaining issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated sidebar interface with session management and rich interaction capabilities, so that I can efficiently manage multiple agent conversations and access all Comrade features in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening Comrade THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated sidebar panel with tabbed session management
2. WHEN creating sessions THEN the system SHALL allow multiple concurrent sessions with individual tab navigation
3. WHEN viewing output THEN the system SHALL render agent responses as formatted markdown in a scrollable area
4. WHEN providing input THEN the system SHALL offer an expandable text box that grows with content up to half the panel height
5. WHEN submitting prompts THEN the system SHALL provide a send button integrated within the input area
6. WHEN using the input area THEN the system SHALL provide a toolbar below the text input containing a "#" button for adding context, a model selection dropdown for the current phase, and a "Comrade" menu button for settings
7. WHEN adding context THEN the "#" toolbar button SHALL open a context menu with options for different input types including media attachment
8. WHEN switching models THEN the model dropdown in the toolbar SHALL change the current phase's agent selection
9. WHEN accessing settings THEN the "Comrade" menu button in the toolbar SHALL provide options for personality configuration, model setup, API connections, and MCP server configuration
10. WHEN selecting personality configuration THEN the system SHALL open the `.comrade/personality.md` file for direct editing
11. WHEN selecting model setup THEN the system SHALL display a configuration screen showing existing agent configurations with options to add, edit, or remove planning and execution agents
12. WHEN selecting API connections THEN the system SHALL display a configuration screen for managing LLM provider credentials and endpoints with secure authentication options
13. WHEN selecting MCP server configuration THEN the system SHALL display a configuration screen showing existing MCP server connections with options to add, edit, or remove server configurations
14. WHEN using configuration screens THEN the system SHALL load each configuration interface as a separate session tab with form-based interfaces for managing settings
10. WHEN transitioning between phases THEN the system SHALL show contextual alerts above the input box with action buttons for phase progression
11. WHEN managing sessions THEN the system SHALL provide new session and history buttons for session lifecycle management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work in both VS Code desktop and web environments, so that I can use it regardless of my development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in VS Code desktop THEN all features SHALL work without limitations
2. WHEN running in VS Code web THEN core functionality SHALL work with appropriate fallbacks for unsupported APIs
3. WHEN file operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's file system APIs for compatibility
4. IF web-specific limitations exist THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality with user notifications
5. WHEN network requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle CORS and other web-specific constraints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to extend agent capabilities with external tools and data sources, so that I can enhance the planning and execution phases with specialized functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agents THEN the system SHALL support MCP server connections alongside standard LLM providers
2. WHEN MCP servers are available THEN agents SHALL be able to invoke MCP tools during planning and execution phases
3. WHEN MCP tools are called THEN the system SHALL handle tool responses and integrate results into agent workflows
4. IF MCP servers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality without blocking core operations
5. WHEN MCP server configurations change THEN the system SHALL reconnect automatically without requiring extension restart

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system architecture to support future expansion to structure mode, so that the MVP investment enables advanced multi-agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the agent system THEN the architecture SHALL support pluggable agent types for different areas of concern
2. WHEN implementing speed mode THEN the code SHALL be structured to easily add context, review, and recovery as separate agents
3. WHEN handling agent communication THEN the system SHALL use abstractions that support both reactive loops and structured workflows
4. IF future modes require different execution patterns THEN the current architecture SHALL accommodate them without major refactoring
5. WHEN adding new agent types THEN the system SHALL support them through configuration without code changes
