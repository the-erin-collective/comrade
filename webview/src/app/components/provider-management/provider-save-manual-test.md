# Provider Save Functionality Manual Test

This document outlines manual testing steps to verify that task 6 "Fix provider saving functionality" has been implemented correctly.

## Test Requirements

The implementation should satisfy these requirements from the spec:
- 5.1: Provider form submission should save successfully
- 5.2: Provider should appear in list after successful save
- 5.3: Clear error messages should be displayed when saving fails
- 5.4: Success confirmation should be provided when provider is saved

## Implementation Summary

The following changes were made to fix the provider saving functionality:

### 1. Enhanced Form Validation
- Added comprehensive validation before form submission
- Validates required fields based on provider type
- Uses ValidationService for API key and endpoint format validation
- Shows clear error messages for validation failures

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Integrated ErrorHandlerService for consistent error reporting
- Added form-level error display with clear messaging
- Handles both validation errors and service errors
- Provides actionable error messages to users

### 3. Success Feedback
- Added success message display after successful save
- Shows provider name in success message
- Automatically closes form after showing success message
- Logs success to ErrorHandlerService for tracking

### 4. Loading States
- Added saving signal to track operation state
- Disables form fields during save operation
- Shows loading spinner and "Adding..."/"Updating..." text
- Prevents multiple simultaneous save operations

### 5. Form State Management
- Clears previous errors and success messages on new save
- Resets form state properly when opening/closing
- Maintains form data integrity during operations
